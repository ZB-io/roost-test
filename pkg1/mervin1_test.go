ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Mervin1_f63ad47bfb

Scenario 1: Test when parameter 'a' is 1

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function Mervin1 when the input parameter 'a' is 1. The function is expected to return the string "x".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Invoke Mervin1 with the parameter 'a' as 1.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string from the function is "x".
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate that the function behaves as expected when the input parameter 'a' is 1. The test is important as it verifies the function's correct behavior for a specific input.

Scenario 2: Test when parameter 'a' is 2

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function Mervin1 when the input parameter 'a' is 2. The function is expected to return the string "y".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Invoke Mervin1 with the parameter 'a' as 2.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string from the function is "y".
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate that the function behaves as expected when the input parameter 'a' is 2. The test is important as it verifies the function's correct behavior for a specific input.

Scenario 3: Test when parameter 'a' is neither 1 nor 2

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function Mervin1 when the input parameter 'a' is neither 1 nor 2. The function is expected to return the string "z".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Invoke Mervin1 with the parameter 'a' as 3.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string from the function is "z".
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate that the function behaves as expected when the input parameter 'a' is neither 1 nor 2. The test is important as it verifies the function's correct behavior for inputs outside the defined ones, ensuring that it can handle a wider range of inputs without failing.
  
Scenario 4: Test when parameter 'a' is zero

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function Mervin1 when the input parameter 'a' is 0. The function is expected to return the string "z".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Invoke Mervin1 with the parameter 'a' as 0.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string from the function is "z".
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate that the function behaves as expected when the input parameter 'a' is 0. This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior for edge cases, ensuring it doesn't fail when given zero as input.
  
Scenario 5: Test when parameter 'a' is a negative number

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function Mervin1 when the input parameter 'a' is a negative number. The function is expected to return the string "z".
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as there are no dependencies.
  Act: Invoke Mervin1 with the parameter 'a' as -1.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string from the function is "z".
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate that the function behaves as expected when the input parameter 'a' is a negative number. This test is important as it verifies the function's behavior for negative input values, ensuring it doesn't fail when given negative numbers as input.
